# Sample Hardhat Project

#### A full-stack web3 project where you can Mint, Transfer and Burn your AAA token. 
##### Using OpenZeppelin, created an ERC20 Token Smart Contract, compiled and deployed to Goerli Testnet using Hardhat. 
##### Used Etherjs in the frontend to interact with the smart contract.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
